# A collection of small exercises about CSS and its reversible declensions  

Most of the documents below can be pre-viewed in github directly, by simply opening the "main.md" file.
However, due to the limitations of github's markdown, it is recommended to refer to the pdf documents, also included.

## Exercises - 0 --- Setting up a Typesetting system

This very brief note indicates how those notes are produced, using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and other standard tools in the Academic field of Theoretical Computer Sciences.
